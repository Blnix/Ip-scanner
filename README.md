# Ip-scanner
Ip scanner with threading and port scanning. 
You will need to edit the settings.json file to your needs.


The base ip is the first three segments of dots: 192.168.1
Normally there would be a number after it, thats the start_ip choice.

Threads will take a lot of cpu ussage, so be carefull.
